# Delightful Babbler

To make your random strings more delightful than just a boring Guid-like thing, this babbler provides lighthearted random strings you can use in your applications. The strings come pre-hyphenated and consist of a positive adjective and the name of an animal. The sampe space is 45'200 different strings.

```csharp
using DelightfulBabbler;

/// ...

var an_string = Babble.Random();
// an_string is now something randomly silly such as "humorous-herring"
```
